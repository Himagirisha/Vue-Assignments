1.Props, which stands for properties,
 enable us to pass data and functionality from one component to another.
 props are read-only(immutable)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Components can specify requirements for their props, such as the types. If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console. 
This is especially useful when developing a component that is intended to be used by others.

To specify prop validations, you can provide an object with validation requirements to the props option, instead of an array of strings. 

props: {
    propC: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
}

3.v-if#
The directive v-if is used to conditionally render a block. 
The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns a truthy value.
